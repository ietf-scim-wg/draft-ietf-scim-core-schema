    <abstract>


<t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications
   are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications
   and services easier.  The specification suite builds upon experience
   with existing schemas and deployments, placing specific emphasis on
   simplicity of development and integration, while applying existing
   authentication, authorization, and privacy models.  Its intent is to
   reduce the cost and complexity of user management operations by
   providing a common user schema and extension model as well as binding
   documents to provide patterns for exchanging this schema using HTTP.</t>

<t>This document provides a platform-neutral schema and extension model
   for representing users and groups and other resource types in JSON
   format.  This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud
   service providers.</t>

<section anchor="introduction-and-overview" title="Introduction and Overview">

<t>While there are existing standards for describing and exchanging user information, many of these standards can be difficult to implement and/or use; e.g., their wire protocols do not easily traverse firewalls and/or are not easily layered onto existing web protocols. As a result, many cloud providers implement non-standardized protocols for managing users within their services.  This increases both the cost and complexity associated with organizations adopting products and services from multiple cloud providers, as they must perform redundant integration development.  Similarly, cloud service providers seeking to interoperate with multiple application marketplaces or cloud identity providers would require pairwise integration.</t>

<t>SCIM seeks to simplify this problem through an easily implemented specification suite that provides a common user schema and extension model, as well as a SCIM protocol document that defines exchanging this schema via an HTTP-based protocol [RFC7644].  The SCIM specifications draw design input and feedback from existing identity-related protocols and schemas from a wide variety of sources including, but not limited to, existing services exposed by cloud providers, PortableContacts [PortableContacts], vCards [RFC6350], and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory services [RFC4512].</t>

<t>The SCIM protocol is an application-level protocol for provisioning and managing identity data specified through SCIM schemas.  The protocol supports creation, modification, retrieval, and discovery of core identity resources such as Users and Groups, using a subset of the HTTP methods (GET for retrieval of resources; POST for creation, searching, and bulk modification; PUT for attribute replacement within resources; PATCH for partial update of attributes; and DELETE for removing resources).</t>

<t>While the SCIM protocol and core schema specifications are intended to cover point-to-point scenarios, implementers and deployers should consider multi-hop and multi-party scenarios such as a service provider acting as a general profile service for in-domain applications (e.g., a directory), as well as scenarios where a service provider in turn passes information to a third-party service provider by acting as either a SCIM client or a SCIM service provider. Implementers and deployers should carefully consider their service level agreements and privacy agreements when distributing or propagating personal information (see Section 9.3).</t>

<t>This document provides a JSON-based schema and extension model for representing users and groups, as well as service provider configuration.  This schema is intended for exchange and use with cloud service providers and other cross-domain scenarios.</t>

<section anchor="requirements-notation-and-conventions" title="Requirements Notation and Conventions">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>

<t>The key words "REQUIRED" and "OPTIONAL" are used throughout this document to indicate whether an attribute or schema element is required or optional.  These key words may be used alone (e.g., "REQUIRED.") or in a sentence. If not specified, an attribute is considered to be optional.</t>

<t>The word "DEFAULT" as used in Section 7 indicates that a "keyword" value for an attribute characteristic is the default behavior.</t>

<t>Throughout this document, values are quoted to indicate that they are to be taken literally.  When using these values in protocol messages, the quotes MUST NOT be used as part of the value.</t>

<t>Throughout this document, figures may contain spaces and extra line wrapping to improve readability and accommodate space limitations. Similarly, some URIs contained within examples have been shortened for space and readability reasons.</t>

<section anchor="definitions" title="Definitions">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="Service Provider">
  An HTTP web application that provides identity information via the
SCIM protocol.</t>
  <t hangText="Client">
  A website or application that uses the SCIM protocol to manage
identity data maintained by the service provider.  The client
initiates SCIM HTTP requests to a target service provider.</t>
  <t hangText="Provisioning Domain">
  A provisioning domain is an administrative domain external to the
domain of a service provider for legal or technical reasons.  For
example, a SCIM client in an enterprise (provisioning client)
communicates with a SCIM service provider that is owned or
controlled by a different legal entity.</t>
  <t hangText="Resource Type">
  A type of a resource that is managed by a service provider.  The
resource type defines the resource name, endpoint URL, schemas,
and other metadata that indicate where a resource is managed and
how it is composed, e.g., "User" or "Group".</t>
  <t hangText="Resource">
  An artifact that is managed by a service provider and that
contains one or more attributes, e.g., "User" or "Group".</t>
  <t hangText="Endpoint">
  An endpoint for a service provider is a defined base path relative
to the service provider's Base URI (see Section 1.3 of [RFC7644]),
over which SCIM operations may be performed against SCIM
resources.  For example, assuming that the service provider's Base
URI is "https://example.com/", "User" resources may be accessed at
the "https://example.com/Users" or "https://example.com/v2/Users"
endpoint (see Section 3.13 of [RFC7644] for details regarding
protocol versioning, e.g., 'v2').  Service provider schemas MAY be
returned from the "/Schemas" endpoint.</t>
  <t hangText="Schema">
  A collection of attribute definitions that describe the contents
of an entire or partial resource, e.g.,
"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User".  The attribute
definitions specify the name of the attribute, and metadata such
as type (e.g., string, binary), cardinality (singular, multi,
complex), mutability, and returnability.</t>
  <t hangText="Singular Attribute">
  A resource attribute that contains 0..1 values, e.g.,
"displayName".</t>
  <t hangText="Multi-valued Attribute">
  A resource attribute that contains 0..n values, e.g., "emails".</t>
  <t hangText="Simple Attribute">
  A singular or multi-valued attribute whose value is a primitive,
e.g., "String".  A simple attribute MUST NOT contain
sub-attributes.</t>
  <t hangText="Complex Attribute">
  A singular or multi-valued attribute whose value is a composition
of one or more simple attributes; e.g., "addresses" has the
sub-attributes "streetAddress", "locality", "postalCode", and
"country".</t>
  <t hangText="Sub-Attribute">
  A simple attribute that is contained within a complex attribute.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="scim-schema" title="SCIM Schema">

<t>A SCIM server provides a set of resources, the allowable contents of which are defined by a set of schema URIs and a resource type. SCIM's schema is not a document-centric one such as with [XML-Schema].  Instead, SCIM's support of schema is attribute based, where each attribute may have different type, mutability, cardinality, or returnability.  Validation of documents and messages is always performed by an intended receiver, as specified by the SCIM specifications.  Validation is performed by the receiver in the context of a SCIM protocol request (see [RFC7644]).  For example, a SCIM service provider, upon receiving a request to replace an existing resource with a replacement JSON object, evaluates each asserted attribute based on its characteristics as defined in the relevant schema (e.g., mutability) and decides which attributes may be replaced or ignored.</t>

<t>This specification provides a minimal core schema for representing users and groups (resources), encompassing common attributes found in many existing deployments and schemas.  In addition to the minimal core schema, this document also specifies a standardized means by which service providers may extend schemas to define new resources and attributes in both standardized and service-provider-specific cases.</t>

<t>Resources are categorized into common resource types such as "User" or "Group".  Collections of resources of the same type are usually contained within the same "container" ("folder") endpoint.</t>

<section anchor="attributes" title="Attributes">

<t>A resource is a collection of attributes identified by one or more schemas.  Minimally, an attribute consists of the attribute name and at least one simple or complex value, either of which may be multi-valued.  For each attribute, a SCIM schema defines the data type, plurality, mutability, and other distinguishing features of an attribute.</t>

<t>Attribute names are case insensitive and are often "camel-cased" (e.g., "camelCase").  SCIM resources are represented in JSON [RFC7159] format and MUST specify schema via the "schemas" attribute per Section 3.</t>

<t>Attribute names MUST conform to the following ABNF rules:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
               ATTRNAME   = ALPHA *(nameChar)
               nameChar   = "$" / "-" / "_" / DIGIT / ALPHA

                    Figure 1: ABNF for Attribute Names

]]></artwork></figure>

<t>The above rules (and other rules in this specification) use the "Core Rules" from ABNF; see Appendix B of [RFC5234].  Unless otherwise specified in this document, all ABNF strings are case insensitive and the character set for these strings is US-ASCII.  For example, all attribute names defined by the above rule are case insensitive.</t>

<t>When defining attribute names, it should be noted that the hyphen ("-") is not permitted in JavaScript attribute names (or in attribute names for some other languages).  While there are no known issues within HTTP protocol and JSON notation, attribute names containing hyphens may need to be escaped when declaring corresponding names of JavaScript attributes.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="attribute-characteristics" title="Attribute Characteristics">

<t>All attributes have a set of characteristics that describe their type
   and handling by a service provider; full definitions may be found in
   Section 7.  The characteristics include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>"required",</t>
  <t>"canonicalValues",</t>
  <t>"caseExact",</t>
  <t>"mutability",</t>
  <t>"returned",</t>
  <t>"uniqueness", and</t>
  <t>"referenceTypes".  <vspace blankLines='1'/>
If not otherwise stated in Section 7, SCIM attributes have the
following characteristics:</t>
  <t>"required" is "false" (i.e., not REQUIRED),</t>
  <t>"canonicalValues": none assigned (for example, the "type" sub-attribute as described in Section 2.4),</t>
  <t>"caseExact" is "false" (i.e., case-insensitive),</t>
  <t>"mutability" is "readWrite" (i.e., modifiable),</t>
  <t>"returned" is "default" (the attribute value is returned by default),</t>
  <t>"uniqueness" is "none" (has no uniqueness enforced), and</t>
  <t>"type" is "string" (Section 2.3.1).</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="attribute-data-types" title="Attribute Data Types">

<t>Attribute data types are derived from JSON [RFC7159].  The JSON
   format defines a limited set of data types; hence, where appropriate,
   alternate JSON representations derived from XML Schema [XML-Schema]
   are defined below.  SCIM extensions SHOULD NOT introduce new data
   types.</t>

</texttable>

<section anchor="string" title="String">

<t>A sequence of zero or more Unicode characters encoded using UTF-8 as
   per [RFC2277] and [RFC3629].  The JSON format is defined in Section 7
   of [RFC7159].  An attribute with SCIM schema type "string" MAY
   specify a required data format.  Additionally, when "canonicalValues"
   is specified, service providers MAY restrict accepted values to the
   specified values.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="boolean" title="Boolean">

<t>The literal "true" or "false".  The JSON format is defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC7159].  A boolean has no case sensitivity or
   uniqueness.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="decimal" title="Decimal">

<t>A real number with at least one digit to the left and right of the
   period.  The JSON format is defined in Section 6 of [RFC7159].  A
   decimal has no case sensitivity.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="integer" title="Integer">

<t>A whole number with no fractional digits or decimal.  The JSON format
   is defined in Section 6 of [RFC7159], with the additional constraint
   that the value MUST NOT contain fractional or exponent parts.  An
   integer has no case sensitivity.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="datetime" title="DateTime">

<t>A DateTime value (e.g., 2008-01-23T04:56:22Z).  The attribute value
   MUST be encoded as a valid xsd:dateTime as specified in Section 3.3.7
   of [XML-Schema] and MUST include both a date and a time.  A date time
   format has no case sensitivity or uniqueness.</t>

<t>Values represented in JSON format MUST conform to the XML constraints
   above and are represented as a JSON string per Section 7 of
   [RFC7159].</t>

</section>
<section anchor="binary" title="Binary">

<t>Arbitrary binary data.  The attribute value MUST be base64 encoded as
   specified in Section 4 of [RFC4648].  In cases where a URL-safe
   encoding is required, the attribute definition MAY specify that
   base64 URL encoding be used as per Section 5 of [RFC4648].  Unless
   otherwise specified in the attribute definition, trailing padding
   characters MAY be omitted ("=").</t>

<t>In JSON representation, the encoded values are represented as a JSON
   string per Section 7 of [RFC7159].  A binary is case exact and has no
   uniqueness.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="reference" title="Reference">

<t>A URI for a resource.  A resource MAY be a SCIM resource, an external
   link to a resource (e.g., a photo), or an identifier such as a URN.
   The value MUST be the absolute or relative URI of the target
   resource.  Relative URIs should be resolved as specified in
   Section 5.2 of [RFC3986].  However, the base URI for relative URI
   resolution MUST include all URI components and path segments up to,
   but not including, the Endpoint URI (the SCIM service provider root
   endpoint); e.g., the base URI for a request to
   "https://example.com/v2/Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646"
   would be "https://example.com/v2/", and the relative URI for this
   resource would be "Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646".</t>

<t>In JSON representation, the URI value is represented as a JSON string
   per Section 7 of [RFC7159].  A reference is case exact.  A reference
   has a "referenceTypes" attribute that indicates what types of
   resources may be linked, as per Section 7 of this document.</t>

<t>A reference URI MUST be to an HTTP-addressable resource.  An HTTP
   client performing a GET operation on a reference URI MUST receive the
   target resource or an appropriate HTTP response code.  A SCIM service
   provider MAY choose to enforce referential integrity for reference
   types referring to SCIM resources.</t>

<t>By convention, a reference is commonly represented as a "$ref"
   sub-attribute in complex or multi-valued attributes; however, this is
   OPTIONAL.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="complex" title="Complex">

<t>A singular or multi-valued attribute whose value is a composition of
   one or more simple attributes.  The JSON format is defined in
   Section 4 of [RFC7159].  The order of the component attributes is not
   significant.  Servers and clients MUST NOT require or expect
   attributes to be in any specific order when an object is either
   generated or analyzed.  A complex attribute has no uniqueness or case
   sensitivity.  A complex attribute MUST NOT contain sub-attributes
   that have sub-attributes (i.e., that are complex).</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="multi-valued-attributes" title="Multi-Valued Attributes">

<t>Multi-valued attributes contain a list of elements using the JSON
   array format defined in Section 5 of [RFC7159].  Elements can be
   either of the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>primitive values, or</t>
  <t>objects with a set of sub-attributes and values, using the JSON
  object format defined in Section 4 of [RFC7159], in which case
  they SHALL be considered to be complex attributes.  As with
  complex attributes, the order of sub-attributes is not
  significant.  The predefined sub-attributes listed in this section
  can be used with multi-valued attribute objects, but these
  sub-attributes MUST be used with the meanings defined here.</t>
</list></t>

<t>If not otherwise defined, the default set of sub-attributes for a multi-valued attribute is as follows:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="type">
  A label indicating the attribute's function, e.g., "work" or "home".</t>
  <t hangText="primary">
  A Boolean value indicating the 'primary' or preferred attribute value for this attribute, e.g., the preferred mailing address or the primary email address.  The primary attribute value "true" MUST appear no more than once.  If not specified, the value of "primary" SHALL be assumed to be "false".</t>
  <t hangText="display">
  A human-readable name, primarily used for display purposes and having a mutability of "immutable".</t>
  <t hangText="value">
  The attribute's significant value, e.g., email address, phone number.</t>
  <t hangText="$ref">
  The reference URI of a target resource, if the attribute is a reference.  URIs are canonicalized per Section 6.2 of [RFC3986]. While the representation of a resource may vary in different SCIM protocol API versions (see Section 3.13 of [RFC7644]), URIs for SCIM resources with an API version SHALL be considered comparable to URIs without a version or with a different version.  For example, "https://example.com/Users/12345" is equivalent to "https://example.com/v2/Users/12345".</t>
</list></t>

<t>When returning multi-valued attributes, service providers SHOULD canonicalize the value returned (e.g., by returning a value for the
sub-attribute "type", such as "home" or "work") when appropriate (e.g., for email addresses and URLs).</t>

<t>Service providers MAY return element objects with the same "value" sub-attribute more than once with a different "type" sub-attribute (e.g., the same email address may be used for work and home) but SHOULD NOT return the same (type, value) combination more than once per attribute, as this complicates processing by the client.</t>

<t>When defining schema for multi-valued attributes, it is considered a good practice to provide a type attribute that MAY be used for the purpose of canonicalization of values.  In the schema definition for an attribute, the service provider MAY define the recommended canonical values (see Section 7).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="unassigned-and-null-values" title="Unassigned and Null Values">

<t>Unassigned attributes, the null value, or an empty array (in the case of a multi-valued attribute) SHALL be considered to be equivalent in "state".  Assigning an attribute with the value "null" or an empty array (in the case of multi-valued attributes) has the effect of making the attribute "unassigned".  When a resource is expressed in JSON format, unassigned attributes, although they are defined in schema, MAY be omitted for compactness.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="scim-resources" title="SCIM Resources">

<t>Each SCIM resource is a JSON object that has the following
components:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="Resource Type">
  Each resource (or JSON object) in SCIM has a resource type ("meta.resourceType"; see Section 3.1) that defines the resource's core attribute schema and any attribute extension schema, as well as the endpoint where objects of the same type may be found.  More information about a resource MAY be found in its resource type definition (see Section 6).</t>
  <t hangText="&quot;Schemas&quot; Attribute">
  The "schemas" attribute is a REQUIRED attribute and is an array of Strings containing URIs that are used to indicate the namespaces of the SCIM schemas that define the attributes present in the current JSON structure.  This attribute may be used by parsers to define the attributes present in the JSON structure that is the body to an HTTP request or response.  Each String value must be a unique URI.  All representations of SCIM schemas MUST include a non-empty array with value(s) of the URIs supported by that representation.  The "schemas" attribute for a resource MUST only contain values defined as "schema" and "schemaExtensions" for the resource's defined "resourceType".  Duplicate values MUST NOT be included.  Value order is not specified and MUST NOT impact behavior.</t>
  <t hangText="Common Attributes">
  A resource's common attributes are those attributes that are part of every SCIM resource, regardless of the value of the "schemas" attribute present in a JSON body.  These attributes are not defined in any particular schema but SHALL be assumed to be present in every resource, regardless of the value of the "schemas" attribute.  See Section 3.1.</t>
  <t hangText="Core Attributes">
  A resource's core attributes are those attributes that sit at the top level of the JSON object together with the common attributes (such as the resource "id").  The list of valid attributes is specified by the resource's resource type "schema" attribute (see Section 6).  This same value is also present in the resource's "schemas" attribute.</t>
  <t hangText="Extended Attributes">
  Extended schema attributes are specified by the resource's resource type "schemaExtensions" attribute (see Section 6). Unlike core attributes, extended attributes are kept in their own sub-attribute namespace identified by the schema extension URI. This avoids attribute name conflicts that may arise due to conflicts from separate schema extensions.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following example "User" contains the common attributes "id" and
"externalId", as well as the complex attribute "meta", which contains
the sub-attribute "resourceType".  The resource also contains core
attributes "userName" and "name", as well as extended enterprise User
attributes "employeeNumber" and "costCenter", which are contained in
their own JSON substructure identified by their schema URI.  Some
values have been omitted (…), shortened, or spaced out for clarity.</t>

<section anchor="common-attributes" title="Common Attributes">

<t>Each SCIM resource (Users, Groups, etc.) includes the following
common attributes.  With the exception of the "ServiceProviderConfig"

provider (e.g., after a SCIM create), the attributes "id" and "meta"

service provider.  Common attributes are considered to be part of
every base resource schema and do not use their own "schemas" URI.</t>

  A String that is an identifier for the resource as defined by the provisioning client.  The "externalId" may simplify identification of a resource between the provisioning client and the service provider by allowing the client to use a filter to locate the resource with an identifier from the provisioning domain, obviating the need to store a local mapping between the provisioning domain's identifier of the resource and the identifier used by the service provider.  Each resource MAY include a non-empty "externalId" value.  The value of the "externalId" attribute is always issued by the provisioning client and MUST NOT be specified by the service provider.  The service provider MUST always interpret the externalId as scoped to the provisioning domain.  While the server does not enforce uniqueness, it is assumed that the value's uniqueness is controlled by the client setting the value.  See Section 9 for additional considerations regarding privacy.  This attribute has "caseExact" as "true" and a mutability of "readWrite".  This attribute is OPTIONAL.</t>
  <t hangText="meta">
  A complex attribute containing resource metadata.  All "meta" sub-attributes are assigned by the service provider (have a "mutability" of "readOnly"), and all of these sub-attributes have a "returned" characteristic of "default".  This attribute SHALL be ignored when provided by clients.  "meta" contains the following sub-attributes:

      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="resourceType">
        The name of the resource type of the resource.  This attribute has a mutability of "readOnly" and "caseExact" as "true".</t>
        <t hangText="created">
        The "DateTime" that the resource was added to the service provider.  This attribute MUST be a DateTime.</t>
        <t hangText="lastModified">
        The most recent DateTime that the details of this resource were updated at the service provider.  If this resource has never been modified since its initial creation, the value MUST be the same as the value of "created".</t>
        <t hangText="location">
        The URI of the resource being returned.  This value MUST be the same as the "Content-Location" HTTP response header (see Section 3.1.4.2 of [RFC7231]).</t>
        <t hangText="version">
        The version of the resource being returned.  This value must be the same as the entity-tag (ETag) HTTP response header (see Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of [RFC7232]).  This attribute has "caseExact" as "true".  Service provider support for this attribute is optional and subject to the service provider's support for versioning (see Section 3.14 of [RFC7644]).  If a service provider provides "version" (entity-tag) for a representation and the generation of that entity-tag does not satisfy all of the characteristics of a strong validator (see Section 2.1 of [RFC7232]), then the origin server MUST mark the "version" (entity-tag) as weak by prefixing its opaque value with "W/" (case sensitive).</t>

<section anchor="defining-new-resource-types" title="Defining New Resource Types">

<t>SCIM may be extended to define new classes of resources by defining a
   resource type.  Each resource type defines the name, endpoint, base
   schema (the attributes), and any schema extensions registered for use
   with the resource type.  In order to offer new types of resources, a
   service provider defines the new resource type as specified in
   Section 6 and defines a schema representation (see Section 8.7).</t>

</section>
<section anchor="attribute-extensions-to-resources" title="Attribute Extensions to Resources">

<t>SCIM allows resource types to have extensions in addition to their
   core schema.  This is similar to how "objectClasses" are used in LDAP
   [RFC4512].  However, unlike LDAP, there is no inheritance model; all
   extensions are additive (similar to the LDAP auxiliary object class).
   Each value in the "schemas" attribute indicates additive schema that
   MAY exist in a SCIM resource representation.  The "schemas" attribute
   MUST contain at least one value, which SHALL be the base schema for
   the resource.  The "schemas" attribute MAY contain additional values
   indicating extended schemas that are in use.  Schema extensions
   SHOULD avoid redefining any attributes defined in this specification
   and SHOULD follow conventions defined in this specification.  Except
   for the base object schema, the schema extension URI SHALL be used as
   a JSON container to distinguish attributes belonging to the extension
   namespace from base schema attributes.  See Figure 5, which is an
   example of the JSON representation of an enterprise User and is also
   an example of a User with extended schema.</t>

<t>In order to determine which URI value in the "schemas" attribute is
   the base schema and which is an extended schema for any given
   resource, the resource's "resourceType" attribute value MAY be used
   to retrieve the resource's "ResourceType" schema (see Section 6).
   See the "ResourceType" representation in Figure 8 for an example.</t>

<section anchor="scim-core-resources-and-extensions" title="SCIM Core Resources and Extensions">

<t>This section defines the default resource schemas present in a SCIM
   server.  SCIM is not exclusive to these resources and may be extended
   to support other resource types (see Section 3.2).</t>

<section anchor="user-resource-schema" title="&quot;User&quot; Resource Schema">

<t>SCIM provides a resource type for "User" resources.  The core schema
   for "User" is identified using the following schema URI:
   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User".  The following
   attributes are defined in addition to the core schema attributes:</t>

<section anchor="singular-attributes" title="Singular Attributes">

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="userName">
  A service provider's unique identifier for the user, typically used by the user to directly authenticate to the service provider. Often displayed to the user as their unique identifier within the system (as opposed to "id" or "externalId", which are generally opaque and not user-friendly identifiers).  Each User MUST include a non-empty userName value.  This identifier MUST be unique across the service provider's entire set of Users.  This attribute is REQUIRED and is case insensitive.</t>
  <t hangText="name">
  The components of the user's name.  Service providers MAY return just the full name as a single string in the formatted sub-attribute, or they MAY return just the individual component attributes using the other sub-attributes, or they MAY return both.  If both variants are returned, they SHOULD be describing the same name, with the formatted name indicating how the component attributes should be combined.</t>
  <t hangText="formatted">
  The full name, including all middle names, titles, and suffixes as appropriate, formatted for display (e.g., "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="familyName">
  The family name of the User, or last name in most Western languages (e.g., "Jensen" given the full name "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="givenName">
  The given name of the User, or first name in most Western languages (e.g., "Barbara" given the full name "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="middleName">
  The middle name(s) of the User (e.g., "Jane" given the full name "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="honorificPrefix">
  The honorific prefix(es) of the User, or title in most Western languages (e.g., "Ms." given the full name "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="honorificSuffix">
  The honorific suffix(es) of the User, or suffix in most Western languages (e.g., "III" given the full name "Ms. Barbara Jane Jensen, III").</t>
  <t hangText="displayName">
  The name of the user, suitable for display to end-users.  Each user returned MAY include a non-empty displayName value.  The name SHOULD be the full name of the User being described, if known (e.g., "Babs Jensen" or "Ms. Barbara J Jensen, III") but MAY be a username or handle, if that is all that is available (e.g., "bjensen").  The value provided SHOULD be the primary textual label by which this User is normally displayed by the service provider when presenting it to end-users.</t>
  <t hangText="nickName">
  The casual way to address the user in real life, e.g., "Bob" or "Bobby" instead of "Robert".  This attribute SHOULD NOT be used to represent a User's username (e.g., bjensen or mpepperidge).</t>
  <t hangText="profileUrl">
  A URI that is a uniform resource locator (as defined in Section 1.1.3 of [RFC3986]) and that points to a location representing the user's online profile (e.g., a web page).  URIs are canonicalized per Section 6.2 of [RFC3986].</t>
  <t hangText="title">
  The user's title, such as "Vice President".</t>
  <t hangText="userType">
  Used to identify the relationship between the organization and the user.  Typical values used might be "Contractor", "Employee", "Intern", "Temp", "External", and "Unknown", but any value may be used.</t>
  <t hangText="preferredLanguage">
  Indicates the user's preferred written or spoken languages and is generally used for selecting a localized user interface.  The value indicates the set of natural languages that are preferred. The format of the value is the same as the HTTP Accept-Language header field (not including "Accept-Language:") and is specified in Section 5.3.5 of [RFC7231].  The intent of this value is to enable cloud applications to perform matching of language tags [RFC4647] to the user's language preferences, regardless of what may be indicated by a user agent (which might be shared), or in an interaction that does not involve a user (such as in a delegated OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] style interaction) where normal HTTP Accept-Language header negotiation cannot take place.</t>
  <t hangText="locale">
  Used to indicate the User's default location for purposes of localizing such items as currency, date time format, or numerical representations.  A valid value is a language tag as defined in [RFC5646].  Computer languages are explicitly excluded.</t>
  <t>A language tag is a sequence of one or more case-insensitive
sub-tags, each separated by a hyphen character ("-", %x2D).  For
backward compatibility, servers MAY accept tags separated by an
underscore character ("_", %x5F).  In most cases, a language tag
consists of a primary language sub-tag that identifies a broad
family of related languages (e.g., "en" = English) and that is
optionally followed by a series of sub-tags that refine or narrow
that language's range (e.g., "en-CA" = the variety of English as
communicated in Canada).  Whitespace is not allowed within a
language tag.  Example tags include:</t>
  <t>fr, en-US, es-419, az-Arab, x-pig-latin, man-Nkoo-GN</t>
  <t>See [RFC5646] for further information.</t>
  <t hangText="timezone">
  The User's time zone, in IANA Time Zone database format [RFC6557], also known as the "Olson" time zone database format [Olson-TZ] (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles").</t>
  <t hangText="active">
  A Boolean value indicating the user's administrative status.  The definitive meaning of this attribute is determined by the service provider.  As a typical example, a value of true implies that the user is able to log in, while a value of false implies that the user's account has been suspended.</t>
  <t hangText="password">
  This attribute is intended to be used as a means to set, replace, or compare (i.e., filter for equality) a password.  The cleartext value or the hashed value of a password SHALL NOT be returnable by a service provider.  If a service provider holds the value locally, the value SHOULD be hashed.  When a password is set or changed by the client, the cleartext password SHOULD be processed by the service provider as follows:

      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Prepare the cleartext value for international language
comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].</t>
        <t>Validate the value against server password policy.  Note: The
definition and enforcement of password policy are beyond the
scope of this document.</t>
        <t>Ensure that the value is encrypted (e.g., hashed).  See
Section 9.2 for acceptable hashing and encryption handling when
storing or persisting for provisioning workflow reasons.</t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>A service provider that immediately passes the cleartext value on to another system or programming interface MUST pass the value directly over a secured connection (e.g., Transport Layer Security (TLS)).  If the value needs to be temporarily persisted for a period of time (e.g., because of a workflow) before provisioning, then the value MUST be protected by some method, such as encryption.</t>
  <t>Testing for an equality match MAY be supported if there is an existing stored hashed value.  When testing for equality, the service provider:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Prepares the filter value for international language
comparison.  See Section 7.8 of [RFC7644].</t>
        <t>Generates the salted hash of the filter value and tests for a
match with the locally held value.</t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t>The mutability of the password attribute is "writeOnly", indicating that the value MUST NOT be returned by a service provider in any form (the attribute characteristic "returned" is "never").</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="multi-valued-attributes-1" title="Multi-Valued Attributes">

<t>The following multi-valued attributes are defined.</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="emails">
  Email addresses for the User.  The value SHOULD be specified according to [RFC5321].  Service providers SHOULD canonicalize the value according to [RFC5321], e.g., "bjensen@example.com" instead of "bjensen@EXAMPLE.COM".  The "display" sub-attribute MAY be used to return the canonicalized representation of the email value. The "type" sub-attribute is used to provide a classification meaningful to the (human) user.  The user interface should encourage the use of basic values of "work", "home", and "other" and MAY allow additional type values to be used at the discretion of SCIM clients.</t>
  <t hangText="phoneNumbers">
  Phone numbers for the user.  The value SHOULD be specified according to the format defined in [RFC3966], e.g., 'tel:+1-201-555-0123'.  Service providers SHOULD canonicalize the value according to [RFC3966] format, when appropriate.  The "display" sub-attribute MAY be used to return the canonicalized representation of the phone number value.  The sub-attribute "type" often has typical values of "work", "home", "mobile", "fax", "pager", and "other" and MAY allow more types to be defined by the SCIM clients.</t>
  <t hangText="ims">
  Instant messaging address for the user.  No official canonicalization rules exist for all instant messaging addresses, but service providers SHOULD, when appropriate, remove all whitespace and convert the address to lowercase.  The "type" sub-attribute SHOULD take one of the following values: "aim", "gtalk", "icq", "xmpp", "msn", "skype", "qq", "yahoo", or "other" (representing currently popular IM services at the time of this writing).  Service providers MAY add further values if new IM services are introduced and MAY specify more detailed canonicalization rules for each possible value.</t>
  <t hangText="photos">
  A URI that is a uniform resource locator (as defined in Section 1.1.3 of [RFC3986]) that points to a resource location representing the user's image.  The resource MUST be a file (e.g., a GIF, JPEG, or PNG image file) rather than a web page containing an image.  Service providers MAY return the same image in different sizes, although it is recognized that no standard for describing images of various sizes currently exists.  Note that this attribute SHOULD NOT be used to send down arbitrary photos taken by this user; instead, profile photos of the user that are suitable for display when describing the user should be sent. Instead of the standard canonical values for type, this attribute defines the following canonical values to represent popular photo sizes: "photo" and "thumbnail".</t>
  <t hangText="addresses">
  A physical mailing address for this user.  Canonical type values of "work", "home", and "other".  This attribute is a complex type with the following sub-attributes.  All sub-attributes are OPTIONAL.

      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="formatted">
        The full mailing address, formatted for display or use with a mailing label.  This attribute MAY contain newlines.</t>
        <t hangText="streetAddress">
        The full street address component, which may include house number, street name, P.O. box, and multi-line extended street address information.  This attribute MAY contain newlines.</t>
        <t hangText="locality">
        The city or locality component.</t>
        <t hangText="region">
        The state or region component.</t>
        <t hangText="postalCode">
        The zip code or postal code component.</t>
        <t hangText="country">
        The country name component.  When specified, the value MUST be in ISO 3166-1 "alpha-2" code format [ISO3166]; e.g., the United States and Sweden are "US" and "SE", respectively.</t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t hangText="groups">
  A list of groups to which the user belongs, either through direct membership, through nested groups, or dynamically calculated.  The values are meant to enable expression of common group-based or role-based access control models, although no explicit authorization model is defined.  It is intended that the semantics of group membership and any behavior or authorization granted as a result of membership are defined by the service provider.  The canonical types "direct" and "indirect" are defined to describe how the group membership was derived.  Direct group membership indicates that the user is directly associated with the group and SHOULD indicate that clients may modify membership through the "Group" resource.  Indirect membership indicates that user membership is transitive or dynamic and implies that clients cannot modify indirect group membership through the "Group" resource but MAY modify direct group membership through the "Group" resource, which may influence indirect memberships.  If the SCIM service provider exposes a "Group" resource, the "value" sub-attribute MUST be the "id", and the "$ref" sub-attribute must be the URI of the corresponding "Group" resources to which the user belongs.  Since this attribute has a mutability of "readOnly", group membership changes MUST be applied via the "Group" Resource (Section 4.2).  This attribute has a mutability of "readOnly".</t>
  <t hangText="entitlements">
  A list of entitlements for the user that represent a thing the user has.  An entitlement may be an additional right to a thing, object, or service.  No vocabulary or syntax is specified; service providers and clients are expected to encode sufficient information in the value so as to accurately and without ambiguity determine what the user has access to.  This value has no canonical types, although a type may be useful as a means to scope entitlements.</t>
  <t hangText="roles">
  A list of roles for the user that collectively represent who the user is, e.g., "Student", "Faculty".  No vocabulary or syntax is specified, although it is expected that a role value is a String or label representing a collection of entitlements.  This value has no canonical types.</t>
  <t hangText="x509Certificates">
  A list of certificates associated with the resource (e.g., a User).  Each value contains exactly one DER-encoded X.509 certificate (see Section 4 of [RFC5280]), which MUST be base64 encoded per Section 4 of [RFC4648].  A single value MUST NOT contain multiple certificates and so does not contain the encoding "SEQUENCE OF Certificate" in any guise.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schema-definition" title="Schema Definition">

<t>This section defines a way to specify the schema in use by resources
   available and accepted by a SCIM service provider.  For each
   "schemas" URI value, this schema specifies the defined attribute(s)
   and their characteristics (mutability, returnability, etc).  For
   every schema URI used in a resource object, there is a corresponding
   "Schema" resource.  "Schema" resources are not modifiable, and their
   associated attributes have a mutability of "readOnly".  Except for
   "id" (which is always returned), all attributes have a "returned"
   characteristic of "default".  Unless otherwise specified, all schema
   attributes are case insensitive.  These resources have a "schemas"
   attribute with the following schema URI:</t>

<t>urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Schema</t>

<t>Unlike other core resources, the "Schema" resource MAY contain a
   complex object within a sub-attribute, and all attributes are
   REQUIRED unless otherwise specified.</t>

<t>The following singular attributes are defined:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="id">
  The unique URI of the schema.  When applicable, service providers MUST specify the URI, e.g., "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User".  Unlike most other schemas, which use some sort of Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the "id", the schema "id" is a URI so that it can be registered and is portable between different service providers and clients.  REQUIRED.</t>
  <t hangText="name">
  The schema's human-readable name.  When applicable, service providers MUST specify the name, e.g., "User" or "Group".  OPTIONAL.</t>
  <t hangText="description">
  The schema's human-readable description.  When applicable, service providers MUST specify the description.  OPTIONAL.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The following multi-valued attribute is defined:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">
  <t hangText="attributes">
  A complex type that defines service provider attributes and their qualities via the following set of sub-attributes:

      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="name">
        The attribute's name.</t>
        <t hangText="type">
        The attribute's data type.  Valid values are "string", "boolean", "decimal", "integer", "dateTime", "reference", and "complex".  When an attribute is of type "complex", there SHOULD be a corresponding schema attribute "subAttributes" defined, listing the sub-attributes of the attribute.</t>
        <t hangText="subAttributes">
        When an attribute is of type "complex", "subAttributes" defines a set of sub-attributes. "subAttributes" has the same schema sub-attributes as "attributes".</t>
        <t hangText="multiValued">
        A Boolean value indicating the attribute's plurality.</t>
        <t hangText="description">
        The attribute's human-readable description.  When applicable, service providers MUST specify the description.</t>
        <t hangText="required">
        A Boolean value that specifies whether or not the attribute is required.</t>
        <t hangText="canonicalValues">
        A collection of suggested canonical values that MAY be used (e.g., "work" and "home").  In some cases, service providers MAY choose to ignore unsupported values.  OPTIONAL.</t>
        <t hangText="caseExact">
        A Boolean value that specifies whether or not a string attribute is case sensitive.  The server SHALL use case sensitivity when evaluating filters.  For attributes that are case exact, the server SHALL preserve case for any value submitted.  If the attribute is case insensitive, the server MAY alter case for a submitted value.  Case sensitivity also impacts how attribute values MAY be compared against filter values (see Section 3.4.2.2 of [RFC7644]).</t>
        <t hangText="mutability">
        A single keyword indicating the circumstances under which the value of the attribute can be (re)defined:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="readOnly">
              The attribute SHALL NOT be modified.</t>
              <t hangText="readWrite">
              The attribute MAY be updated and read at any time. This is the default value.</t>
              <t hangText="immutable">
              The attribute MAY be defined at resource creation (e.g., POST) or at record replacement via a request (e.g., a PUT).  The attribute SHALL NOT be updated.</t>
              <t hangText="writeOnly">
              The attribute MAY be updated at any time.  Attribute values SHALL NOT be returned (e.g., because the value is a stored hash).  Note: An attribute with a mutability of "writeOnly" usually also has a returned setting of "never".</t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t hangText="returned">
        A single keyword that indicates when an attribute and associated values are returned in response to a GET request or in response to a PUT, POST, or PATCH request.  Valid keywords are as follows:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="always">
              The attribute is always returned, regardless of the contents of the "attributes" parameter.  For example, "id" is always returned to identify a SCIM resource.</t>
              <t hangText="never">
              The attribute is never returned.  This may occur because the original attribute value (e.g., a hashed value) is not retained by the service provider.  A service provider MAY allow attributes to be used in a search filter.</t>
              <t hangText="default">
              The attribute is returned by default in all SCIM operation responses where attribute values are returned.  If the GET request "attributes" parameter is specified, attribute values are only returned if the attribute is named in the "attributes" parameter.  DEFAULT.</t>
              <t hangText="request">
              The attribute is returned in response to any PUT, POST, or PATCH operations if the attribute was specified by the client (for example, the attribute was modified).  The attribute is returned in a SCIM query operation only if specified in the "attributes" parameter.</t>
            </list>
        </t>
        <t hangText="uniqueness">
        A single keyword value that specifies how the service provider enforces uniqueness of attribute values.  A server MAY reject an invalid value based on uniqueness by returning HTTP response code 400 (Bad Request).  A client MAY enforce uniqueness on the client side to a greater degree than the service provider enforces.  For example, a client could make a value unique while the server has uniqueness of "none".  Valid keywords are as follows:

            <list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="none">
              The values are not intended to be unique in any way.  DEFAULT.</t>
              <t hangText="server">
              The value SHOULD be unique within the context of the current SCIM endpoint (or tenancy) and MAY be globally unique (e.g., a "username", email address, or other server-generated key or counter).  No two resources on the same server SHOULD possess the same value.</t>
              <t hangText="global">
              The value SHOULD be globally unique (e.g., an email address, a GUID, or other value).  No two resources on any server SHOULD possess the same value.</t>
            </list>
        </t>
      </list>
  </t>
  <t hangText="referenceTypes">
  A multi-valued array of JSON strings that indicate the SCIM resource types that may be referenced.  Valid values are as follows:</t>
</list></t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>A SCIM resource type (e.g., "User" or "Group"),</t>
  <t>"external" - indicating that the resource is an external
resource (e.g., a photo), or</t>
  <t>"uri" - indicating that the reference is to a service
endpoint or an identifier (e.g., a schema URN).</t>
</list></t>

<t>: This attribute is only applicable for attributes that are of
type "reference" (Section 2.3.7).</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<section anchor="protocol" title="Protocol">

<t>SCIM data is intended to be exchanged using the SCIM protocol.  It is
   important when handling data to implement the security considerations
   outlined in Section 7 of [RFC7644].</t>

</section>
<section anchor="passwords-and-other-sensitive-security-data" title="Passwords and Other Sensitive Security Data">

<t>Passwords and other attributes related to security credentials are of
   an extremely sensitive nature and require special handling when
   transmitted or stored.  While the SCIM protocol uses cleartext
   passwords for value assignment and equality-testing purposes,
   password values MUST NOT be stored in cleartext form.</t>

<t>Administrators should undertake industry best practices to protect
   the storage of credentials and in particular SHOULD follow
   recommendations outlined in Section 5.1.4.1 of [RFC6819].  These
   requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Provide injection attack countermeasures (e.g., by validating all
inputs and parameters);</t>
  <t>Credentials should not be stored in cleartext form;</t>
  <t>Store credentials using an encrypted protection mechanism (e.g.,
hashing); and</t>
  <t>Where possible, avoid passwords as the sole form of
authentication, and consider using credentials that are based on
asymmetric cryptography.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="privacy" title="Privacy">

<t>The SCIM core schema defines attributes that are sensitive and may be
   considered personally identifying information (PII).  These privacy
   considerations should be considered for extensions as well as the
   schema defined in this specification.</t>

<t>For the purposes of this specification, PII is defined as any
   attribute that may be used as a unique key to identify a person
   (e.g., "User").  Since other information may be used in combination
   to identify an individual, all attributes in SCIM are considered
   "sensitive" personal information.  Consult regional jurisdictions to
   see if there are special considerations for the handling of personal
   information (e.g., PII).</t>

<t>Information should be shared on an as-needed basis.  A SCIM client
   should limit information to what it believes a service provider
   requires, and a SCIM service provider should only accept information
   it needs.  Clients and service providers should take into
   consideration that personal information is being conveyed across
   technical (e.g., protocol and applications), administrative (e.g.,
   organizational, corporate), and jurisdictional boundaries.  In
   particular, information security and privacy must be considered.</t>

<t>Security service level agreements for the handling of these
   attributes are beyond the scope of this document but are to be
   carefully considered by implementers and deploying organizations.</t>

<t>Please see the Privacy Considerations section of [RFC7644] for more
   protocol-specific considerations regarding the handling of SCIM
   information.</t>

<t>SCIM defines attributes such as "id", "externalId", and SCIM resource
   URIs, which cause new PII to be generated; this information is
   important to the way that the SCIM protocol identifies and locates
   resources.  Where possible, it is suggested that service providers
   take the following remediations:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Where possible, assign and bind identifiers to specific tenants
and/or clients.  When multiple tenants are able to reference the
same resource, they should do so via separate identifiers (id or
externalId).  This ensures that separate domains linked to the
same information cannot perform identifier correlation.</t>
  <t>In the case of "externalId", if multiple values are supported, use
access control to restrict access to the client domain that
assigned the "externalId" value.</t>
  <t>Ensure that access to data is appropriately restricted to
authorized parties with a "need to know".</t>
  <t>When persisted, ensure that the appropriate protection mechanisms
are in place to restrict access by unauthorized parties, including
administrators or parties with access to backup data.</t>

<section anchor="registering-scim-schemas" title="Registering SCIM Schemas">

<t>This section defines the process for registering new SCIM schemas
   with IANA in the "System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
   Schema URIs" registry (see Section 10.1).  A schema URI is used as a
   value in the "schemas" attribute (Section 3) for the purpose of
   distinguishing extensions used in a SCIM resource.</t>

<section anchor="registration-procedure" title="Registration Procedure">

<t>The IETF has created a mailing list, scim@ietf.org, which can be used
   for public discussion of SCIM schema proposals prior to registration.
   Use of the mailing list is strongly encouraged.  The IESG has
   appointed a designated expert [RFC5226] who will monitor the
   scim@ietf.org mailing list and review registrations.</t>

<t>Registration of new "core" schemas (e.g., in the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core") and "API" schemas (e.g., in the
   namespace "urn:ietf:params:scim:api") MUST be reviewed by the
   designated expert and published in an RFC.  An RFC is REQUIRED for
   the registration of new value data types that modify existing
   properties.  An RFC is also REQUIRED for registration of SCIM schema
   URIs that modify SCIM schema previously documented in an existing
   RFC.  URNs within "urn:ietf:params:scim" but outside the above
   namespaces MAY be registered with a simple review (e.g., check for
   spam) by the designated expert on a first-come-first-served basis.</t>

<t>The registration procedure begins when a completed registration
   template, defined in the sections below, is sent to scim@ietf.org and
   iana@iana.org.  Within two weeks, the designated expert is expected
   to tell IANA and the submitter of the registration whether the
   registration is approved, approved with minor changes, or rejected
   with cause.  When a registration is rejected with cause, it can be
   resubmitted if the concerns listed in the cause are addressed.</t>

<t>Decisions made by the designated expert can be appealed to the IESG
   Applications Area Director, then to the IESG.  They follow the normal
   appeals procedure for IESG decisions.</t>

<t>Once the registration procedure concludes successfully, IANA creates
   or modifies the corresponding record in the SCIM schema registry.
   The completed registration template is discarded.</t>

<t>An RFC specifying one or more new schema URIs MUST include the
   completed registration templates, which MAY be expanded with
   additional information.  These completed templates are intended to go
   in the body of the document, not in the IANA Considerations section.
   The RFC SHOULD include any attributes defined.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="schema-registration-template" title="Schema Registration Template">

<t>A SCIM schema URI is defined by completing the following template:</t>

<t>Schema URI:  A unique URI for the SCIM schema extension.</t>

<t>Schema Name:  A descriptive name of the schema extension (e.g.,
      "Generic Device").</t>

<t>Intended or Associated Resource Type:  A value defining the resource
      type (e.g., "Device").</t>

<t>Purpose:  A description of the purpose of the extension and/or its
      intended use.</t>

<t>Single-value Attributes:  A list and description of single-valued
