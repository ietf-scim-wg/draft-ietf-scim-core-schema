# IETF SCIM Working Group

This is the working area for the [SCIM Working Group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scim).   If you are interested in participating in this working group, please join our [mailing list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/scim), and from our mailing list request access to our [Slack]( https://scim.slack.com/).  Please review the [Charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-scim/) of our work.  For those new to this process and the IETF, it may be helpful to read the [The Tao of the IETF](https://www.ietf.org/tao.html).

# SCIM Schema Work

This repo exists to organize work on revising the SCIM 2.0 schema published at https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643. The XML version of the currently published SCIM 2.0 schema doc (RFC 7643) is in this repo as **Current RFC7643 - draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-22.xml**. The file being used to track proposed changes to RFC 7643 is **Draft - Revised 7643 - draft-ietf-scim-core-schema-23.xml**. Please raise issues and submit any changes against the Draft document, leaving the "Current RFC7643" document as read-only for easy reference to the original state of the file.
